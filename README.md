# redis-ui

A simple Redis Desktop UI build with electron.

# Features

Currently the only supported feature is this:

* Sends a query and displays the result.

This is in pre-alpha-alpha status right now, but hopefully will support the planned features soon:

# Planned Features

* Scan and delete groups of keys
* Watch puhsub channels and output messages

# Possible future plans

If useful, I may expand this to working with other databases, such as MongoDB or *SQL databases

# How to use

Currently only runs via  npm script. `npm start`. Will use `electron-packager` in the future.
